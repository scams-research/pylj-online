# About the Package

Pylj is an open-source Python library to facilitate student interaction with classical atomistic simulation. It is designed to operate within the Jupyter notebook framework, making it easy to implement in the classroom, or computer lab.

It can perform the simulation of a 2D system by molecular dynamics, with both NVE and NVT ensembles available and making use of a Velocity-Verlet integrator, as well as Metropolis Monte-Carlo simulations.

To see the package source code, you can check out the main [repository](https://github.com/arm61/pylj), also available there is some example Jupyter notebooks.
